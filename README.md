# car-price-prediction

Welcome to the *Car Price Prediction* project! This project predicts the price of a car based on various attributes using *Machine Learning*. If you're interested in understanding how data and algorithms help estimate car prices, this project is for you!  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project utilizes historical car data, processes it, and applies a *Machine Learning Model* to predict car prices. It can help car buyers, sellers, and dealerships estimate a car's value before making a deal.  

---

## 🔥 Features  
- Predicts car prices based on *key attributes* (brand, model, year, mileage, etc.).  
- Uses *Machine Learning* for accurate predictions.  
- Performs *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* to visualize trends.  
- Implements multiple ML models to determine the best-performing one.  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- *Python* 🐍  
- *Jupyter Notebook* 📒  
- *Pandas, NumPy* (Data Processing)  
- *Matplotlib, Seaborn* (Data Visualization)  
- *Scikit-Learn, XGBoost* (Machine Learning)

## 📂 Dataset Information  
The dataset includes key attributes that influence car pricing:  

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| make| machine firm |
| model| machine model |
|price USD| price in USD (target variable)|
| year| year of production|
| condition| represents the condition at the sale moment (with mileage, for parts, etc)|
| mileage| mileage in kilometers|
| fuel type| type of the fuel (electro, petrol, diesel)|
| volume(cm3)| volume of the engine in cubic centimeters|
| color| color of the car|
| transmission| type of transmission|
| drive unit| drive unit|
| segment| segment of the car|

## 🖼 Project Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing  
- Load and clean the dataset.  
- Handle missing values and outliers.  
- Convert categorical values into numerical ones.  


---

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualize data distributions, correlations, and patterns.  
- Analyze the relationship between *car attributes* and *price*.  


---

### 3️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation  
- Train multiple *Machine Learning models* (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- Evaluate models using *R² Score, MAE, MSE, and RMSE*.  
- Identify the best-performing model for car price prediction.

## 📊 Model Performance Summary  
🏆 *Best Model Selection Based on Performance Metrics*  

| Model | R² Score (Higher is Better) | MAE (Lower is Better) | MSE (Lower is Better) | RMSE (Lower is Better) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *Decision Tree Regressor* | 0.8530 | 1414.28 | 4,704,555.78 | 2,169.00 |
| *Random Forest Regressor* | 0.8841 ✅ | 1235.15 ✅ | 3,710,451.47 ✅ | 1,926.25 ✅ |
| *XGBoost Regressor* | *0.8883 ✅* | *1226.00 ✅* | *3,575,182.77 ✅* | *1,890.82 ✅* |
| *Linear Regression* | 0.8316 | 1563.71 | 5,388,411.90 | 2,321.30 |

📌 *Best Model Selection*  
- *XGBoost Regressor* is the best model as it has:  
  - ✅ The *highest R² Score (0.8883)* → Best at explaining price variations.  
  - ✅ The *lowest MAE (1226.00)* → Most accurate on average.  
  - ✅ The *lowest MSE (3,575,182.77) & RMSE (1,890.82)* → Least prediction error.
